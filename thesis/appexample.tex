\chapter{Example Program}
In order to demonstrate the success of the \textit{Confuzzer} system, we've
included the code for a simple test application as well as excerpts from its
execution under the Confuzzer system. Using a single execution node, this test
took about 14 hours and generated a total of around 40500 unique inputs, without
pruning, to the program. 

\lstinputlisting[language=C++]{test4.c}

This program works by taking in 8 instructions as part of a text file, each of
which could either ``[l]ist'' the files that have been created, ``[w]rite'' a
new file, or ``[d]ump'' the contents of the files. Due to an implementation bug,
this code has a memory corruption error if too many files are written. Since
this was compiled on a 64-bit system, this tends to occur when more than 4 files
are written to memory. Below is a part of the output from the fuzzer, showing
the test cases that were sent to the Taint Analyzer, as well as the newly
generated test cases from each execution:

A subset of the crashing inputs that were discovered is below:

\begin{verbatim}
Crashing Inputs:
        $_wwwwdw
        $_wwwwlw
        $wdwwwdw
        $wdwwwwl
        $wldwwww
        $wlw_www
        $wlwdwww
        $wlww_ww
        $wlwwww
...
\end{verbatim}

This along with the remaining crashing inputs covers most of the space of inputs
that should crash the program, showing that even with a program that has a
combinatorial explosion of paths $4^8$, Confuzzer is still able to function in a
reasonable amount of time. The 14 hours for $~40000$ paths matches closely with
the results observed by the SAGE system \cite{sage}. With the use of N nodes,
the time needed to run this test could be reduced by about a factor of $N$,
since the majority of the time was spent in the actual execution of the programs
with different inputs.
