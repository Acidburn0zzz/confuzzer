In this thesis, I designed and implemented \textit{Confuzzer}, a system that
fuzzes closed source binaries using Concolic Execution techniques in order to
find vulnerable inputs into programs that could be leveraged by attackers to
compromise systems that the binary might be running on. The system primarily
consists of a Taint and Crash Analysis tool built on top of Intel PIN, a Dynamic
Binary Instrumentation Tool, a Path Exploration system written in Python using
the z3 SMT solver to parse the tainted paths and generate symbolic equations for
those paths, and a set of nodes that receive test inputs and run the Taint/Crash
Analysis tool in order to allow for parallelization of fuzzing tasks.
